        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Kerlan Augustine. I'm age 23 and am currently going to Humber College for Computer Programming.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include gaming and drawing. As for my goals for this course, and this program as a whole, I wish to learn more about what goes into these technologies and systems, as well as relearn coding techniques that I've learned in the past. From there, I wish to pursue a career in Cybersecurity and Web development.</p>
    <p>That's all for now. Thank you for taking a look at my pages. I'll be sure to update the site as I gain more knowledge. Take care!</p>
